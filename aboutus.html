        <p>The Hosts of The Film Scoop Podcast are Cash McCray and Carl Maxwell,
            who are brothers in law.
            They started the podcast in February of 2023 with an 
            epsiode on Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania. Carl grew up 
        watching films with his family at a young age while Cash 
        adopted his love for film when he was 19 years old. 
      </p>
      <p>They pride themselves on their podcast being
         authentic and uncut. They give their honest
        opinion on films and television, no matter 
    the cost. Because they arent the heroes that Gotham deserves,
     but the one it needs right now. They upload
     weekly episodes about new and old films and they
      always discuss what they have been watching that week.   </p>
